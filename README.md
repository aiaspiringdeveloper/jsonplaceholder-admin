# JSONPlaceholder Admin — Assignment by Maiwand Kakar

A clean, modern admin UI to browse **Users** and **Posts** from [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).  
Built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **ESLint**. Deployed on **Vercel**.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Homepage** with links to Users and Posts  
- **Users**: list + CRUD (id, name, username, email)  
- **Posts**: list + CRUD (userId, id, title)  
- Show relation via `userId → user name`  
- Responsive dark UI with modern styling  
- ESLint clean (no linting errors)  

> ⚠️ JSONPlaceholder accepts `POST/PUT/DELETE` but **does not persist** changes.  
> The UI uses **optimistic updates** for demo purposes.

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript  
- Vite (dev server & build)  
- ESLint (flat config)  
- JSONPlaceholder API (mock REST backend)

---

📌 Paste this file in the root (same folder as `package.json`).  

👉 Next step: run **`npm run lint`** to check for ESLint errors before pushing to GitHub.  

Do you want me to walk you through **running ESLint** and fixing issues if they pop up?
